# Eric Ervin's Personal/Professional Homepage

I'm often asked to share things I'm working on. Unfortunately, I rarely feel that I have anything "complete" enough for others to look over. This is nonsense really, and I need to get over myself. If people are going to judge, so be it. Whenever I get an itch from now on, I'll try to post it here. Let's see where this goes.

**No promises that this will be maintained. I'm not the best at follow through with things like this.**

Oh, I almost forgot, **NOTHING ON THIS SITE IS FINANCIAL ADVICE! EVEN IF IT SOUNDS LIKE FINANCIAL ADVICE!**

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/eervin123/eervin123.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
